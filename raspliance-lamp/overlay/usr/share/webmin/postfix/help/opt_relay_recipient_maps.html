<header>Map for allowed addresses for relaying</header>

When this option is set to a map like <tt>hash:/etc/postfix/relay_recipients</tt>, only addresses with a key in that map will be accepted when email is relayed through this system. This can be useful to prevent spammers from sending email with faked from addresses that will be bounced back when email is relayed to the destination server.  <p>
